## ToDo List
- [ ] Allow user to change scroll method without reopening libreoffice.
  - This requires figuring out "permanence" between script activations.
- [x] Add a menu entry for activating sync/selecting sync method.
  - choose to sync inactive window by:
    - [x] scrollbar
      - [x] by position (maybe useful if the active document is just a beginning part of the full document)
        - position is based on distance from the start of the document
      - [x] by percentage (maybe useful for comparing two completed documents)
        - "percentage" is based on the position of the <i>top</i> of the scroll bar, so it may seem glitchy on a relatively short document (i.e. just 2 or 3 pages)
    - [ ] content location
      - by headings (maybe useful for easily finding related sections but where paragraph counts could vary within a section)
      - by all paragraphs (maybe useful if both files have exact same paragraph structure)
    - [ ] disabled (default action)
