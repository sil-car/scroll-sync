## ToDo List
  - [ ] Add config window.
    - choose to sync inactive window by:
      - scrollbar
        - by position (maybe useful if the active document is just a beginning part of the full document)
        - by percentage (maybe useful for comparing two completed documents)
      - content location
        - by headings (maybe useful for easily finding related sections but where paragraph counts could vary within a section)
        - by all paragraphs (maybe useful if both files have exact same paragraph structure)
  - [ ] Add a menu entry to open config window.
